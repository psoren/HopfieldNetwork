# HopfieldNetwork

This is a simple hopfield network implementation that lets create patterns and store them in the network.  Once you have stored a pattern, you can input new patterns, and the network will display the pattern that it thinks most resembles the pattern that you have input.


For example, say we store the following patterns in the network:

Pattern 1: 
![pattern1](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/pattern1.png)

Pattern 2: 
![pattern2](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/pattern2.png)

Pattern 3: 
![pattern3](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/pattern3.png)

Then, when we input the following patterns and press "run", the network will display the picture that it thinks is most like the picture that you input.

Input 1: 
![Input1](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/recreation1.png)

Input 2: 
![Input2](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/recreation2.png)

Input 3: 
![Input2](https://github.com/psoren/HopfieldNetwork/blob/master/recreation3.png)

So, pattern 1 is recognized when input 1 is presented to the network, pattern 2 is recognized when input 2 is presented to the network, and pattern 3 is recognized when input 3 is presented to the network.

You can change the size of the network in the code as well.
